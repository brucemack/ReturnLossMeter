# KC1FSZ Return Loss/VSWR Meter

Uses a 128x32 OLED driven by the standard SSD1306 chip.

Connect the forward voltage sample to the A0 analog input and the reverse
voltage sample to the A1 analog input.

There are four number shown on the display:

1. VSWR
2. Return loss (dB)
3. Forward power (watts)
4. Voltage of forward power sensor (volts)

This picture was taken while transmitting from my home-brew BITX-40/80.  The
SWR is 1.1, the return loss is 24dB, the transmitter power is 2.6 watts,
and the voltage sampled on the forward side of the Stockton bridge is 1.3 volts.
